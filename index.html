          <p>Game-Off is a game competition held monthly on <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/about/">Scratch</a>. It lasts for a single week during which contestants create and enter a game coded in the Scratch language. Each contest has a theme to which entrants' games must adhere to.</p>

                  <p>All entrants must use the Scratch coding language to create their games. Any games not created using this language are <b>not permitted</b> and will be disqualified without repeal.</p>

                  <p>The game you submit must contain assets created exclusively by you <b>with exception to music, which must be properly attributed</b>. That means that all code and graphics featured in the project must be created by your own hand, or that of a team member's.</p>

                  <p>All entrants have exactly one week to create their game, and they may submit <b>only one</b> within this timeframe. If an entrant or team submits more than one project, none will be judged. You may revise your game before the time limit or enter a new game as long as your old entry is unshared.</p>

                  <p>Teamwork is allowed, but <b>inter-teamwork is not</b>. Teams may have up to three people, all of whom will share the spoils. Please credit your team members so they may receive the prizes they deserve, given your group wins the competition.</p>
